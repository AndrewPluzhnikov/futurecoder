It's time to learn about a powerful new type of value called lists. Here's an example:

__program_indented__
        """

        def program(self):
            words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list']

    class can_contain_anything(VerbatimStep):
        """
A list is a *sequence* (an ordered collection/container) of any number of values.
The values are often referred to as *elements*.
They can be anything: numbers, strings, booleans, even lists! They can also be a mixture of types.

To create a list directly, like above:

1. Write some square brackets: `[]`
2. If you don't want an empty list, write some expressions inside to be the elements.
3. Put commas (`,`) between elements to separate them.

Here's another example of making a list:

__program_indented__
        """

        def program(self):
            x = 1
            things = ['Hello', x, x + 3]
            print(things)

    class numbers_sum(VerbatimStep):
        """
As you saw above, lists are *iterable*, meaning you can iterate over them with a `for loop`.
Here's a program that adds up all the numbers in a list:

__program_indented__
        """

        def program(self):
            numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9]

            total = 0
            for number in numbers:
                total += number

            print(total)

    class strings_sum(ExerciseStep):
        """
Now modify the program so that it can add up a list of strings instead of numbers.
For example, given:

    words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list']

it should print:

    Thisisalist
        """

        hints = """
This is very similar to the exercises you've done building up strings character by character.
The solution is very similar to the program that adds numbers.
In fact, what happens if you try running that program with a list of strings?
The problem is that 0. You can't add 0 to a string because numbers and strings are incompatible.
Is there a similar concept among strings to 0? A blank initial value?

            total = ''

            print(total)

        ]

    class double_numbers(ExerciseStep):
        """
Optional bonus challenge: extend the program to insert a separator string *between* each word.
For example, given

    words = ['This', 'is', 'a', 'list']
    separator = ' - '

it would output:

    This - is - a - list

Lists and strings have a lot in common.
For example, you can add two lists to combine them together into a new list.
You can also create an empty list that has no elements.
Check for yourself:

    numbers = [1, 2] + [3, 4]
    print(numbers)
    new_numbers = []
    new_numbers += numbers
    new_numbers += [5]
    print(new_numbers)

With that knowledge, write a program which takes a list of numbers
and prints a list where each number has been doubled. For example, given:

    numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]

it would print:

    [6, 2, 8, 2, 10, 18, 4, 12, 10]
        """

        hints = """
Remember that you can multiply numbers using `*`.
This program is structurally very similar to the programs you've written to build up strings character by character.
Make a new list, and then build it up element by element in a for loop.
Start with an empty list.
You can make a list with one element `x` by just writing `[x]`.
You can add an element to a list by adding a list containing one element.

Great!

When you want to add a single element to the end of a list, instead of:

    some_list += [element]

it's actually more common to write:

    some_list.append(element)

There isn't really a big difference between these, but `.append`
will be more familiar and readable to most people.

Now use `.append` to write a program which prints a list containing only the numbers bigger than 5.

For example, given:

    numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5]

it would print:

    [9, 6]

This is very similar to the previous exercise.
The difference is that sometimes you should skip appending to the new list.
Use an `if` statement.
Use a comparison operator to test if a number is big enough to add.

Nice!

A typical solution looks something like this:

    found = False
    for thing in things:
        if thing == thing_to_find:
            found = True

    print(found)

Your solution is probably similar. It's fine, but it's a bit inefficient.
That's because it'll loop over the entire list even if it finds the element at the beginning.
You can stop any loop using a `break` statement, like so:

    for thing in things:
        if thing == thing_to_find:
            found = True
            break

This is just as correct but skips unnecessary iterations and checks once it finds the element.
You can use snoop to see the difference.
