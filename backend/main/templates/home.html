            This is a free open source platform/course for complete beginners to teach themselves programming,
            specifically in Python.

        <p>
            This site is intended for demonstration, not large scale usage.
            So don't start sharing it with everyone who wants to learn to code.
            It's hosted on free, minimal infrastructure that can't handle a lot of load.
        </p>

        <p>
            But please share this with people who are interested in providing free education
            and contributing to open source software!
