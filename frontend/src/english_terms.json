This is a tool to help you write a good quality question that is likely to get answers.\n\nEnter and run your code on the right. If you don't have any code because you don't know where to get started, I'm afraid this tool can't help you. You can still ask for help, but it might be good to first read [What types of questions should I avoid asking?](https://stackoverflow.com/help/dont-ask)\n\nIf your question is about servers (e.g. Django or Flask), web requests, databases, or a package that can't be imported here, then this tool won't work. However, just because your current code *involves* those things, that doesn't mean that's what your question is *about*. If you're having a general Python/programming/logic problem, then extract that problem from the other stuff. Python with Django is still Python. If you can't do that, then read [How to create a Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) before asking your question.",
